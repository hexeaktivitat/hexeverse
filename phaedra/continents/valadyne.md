# Valadyne

## The Southern Reaches

A densely forested region, with cleared out rolling lowlands near river intersections and deltas providing farmland and urban configurations. A large swamp lies at the center of the region, surrounded by rain forest; a curious dead end of the many rivers in the area. The Southern Reaches are separated from the Northern Reaches of Valadyne by the Pyrrhu Mountains. Off the coast lies the Limnnos Archipelago, where the Valadyne Tower connects the surface to the sky islands.

### Nations

- Hyrrus, crown jewel of the Valadyne continent, home to the Tempel and guardians of the Valadyne Tower. (Triumph)
    - Long ago, the secret paths in the Valadyne Tower were discovered by the Hyrrus noblity, and the way to the sky islands has been kept secret since.
    - Nobility are one of the few non-members of the Tempel to be inducted in the secrets of the stars.
- Ptha, long a nation of turmoil and civil strife, now finds itself under the stewardship of a new leader. (Renewal)
    - This new leader is the head of a new upsurgent religious sect that many (though not all) of the citizenry converted to.
    - Prior to the ascendance, many nobles claimed rule over the lands, and fought endless bloody wars for centuries.
- Vicirx, land-locked to the northern mountain ranges of Pyrrhu, constantly searching for new territory to consume. (Expansion)
    - Long ago, its elite citizenry left to found the twin nations of Phonelia and Biylilca, leaving behind the working classes.
    - Deep exploration in the mountains has given them access to metals and alloys unknown to any other nation. While useless for armor, these alloys make for perfectly concealable weapons, perfect for the assassination trade.
- Phonelia, an artist's haven ruled for centuries by the Phonos, a continuously shifting elected body comprised of the finest artists in the land. (Legitmacy)
    - Deep underground, the musicologists have discovered a bizarre resonant chamber and reflecting pool. Different tones and overtones and harmonies change the view in the reflecting pool. Many suspect that this chamber could be a portal to other worlds.
    - This chamber was only discovered after an enormous earthquake caused by Biylilca's inecessant experimentation with gravitonic magicks.
- Biylilca, a scholastic counterpart and neighbor to Phonelia, notorious for being selective about its citizens and its lack of centralized governance (Enlightenment)
    - Following the tyrannical rule of the Scholar-Mage, the Biylilcans dissolved all forms of federated governance, leaving local citizens to band together in anarchic communities.
    - Secret cabals following the Scholar-Mage lurk in isolated cells in almost every village, biding their time for the chance to rule again.

### Relationships

- Hyrrus
    - Ptha was formerly an ally before the civil disturbances began; they are suspicious of the new leader and their religion.
    - Vicirx once led a conquest that nearly toppled the Hyrruian people, and only the discovery of the secrets of the Tower enabled them to survive.
    - Phonelia is a close ally in almost all matters; Phonelia keeps Hyrrus well stocked with the culture they desire, while in turn Hyrrus protects the state to allow them to pursue their arts and sciences undisturbed.
    - Biylilca is largely ignored, seen as a bizarre nation of eclectic mages and scientists.
- Ptha
    - The new leader covets the power and status afforded Hyrrian noblity, and seems especially focused on access to the Tower.
    - Vicirx is an ancient enemy, a source of endless border disputes, and they have been forced to cede much territory over the past few years as a result
    - Phonelia was once a luxury destination for so many of the population, but the strife has soured their relationship
    - Biylilca has provided technological aid to several of the claimants to power, seemingly playing both against the middle.
- Vicirx
    - Hyrrus has long been a rival, but they have long since given up any ambitions to the archipalago - not that anyone has told Hyrrus, of course.
    - Ptha has ceded much of their recent territorial acquisitions, and they are carefully monitoring the situation with the new leader for a reason to intervene.
    - Phonelia has a longtime cultural connection with them, but the Vicirx have never forgotten the betrayal.
    - Their attempt to rule Biylilca covertly through the Scholar-Mage failed centuries ago, and they have been secretly funding the cabals
- Phonelia
    - Hyrrus has supplied many of their most famous artists, so they are eternally grateful for their connection.
    - Ptha's new leader has yet to be seen as an appreciator of the arts and sciences, and due to the nature of their religion, they are wary about maintaining their historical ties
    - Vicirx is often spoken of with scorn and derision by most of the populace, seen largely as uncouth and militaristic.
    - Biylilca is their sister-state, so they are close, and formally cooperate on many cultural and scientific matters. Informally, however, there is always a slight tinge of disregard for a nation of "mad scientists and mages"
- Biylilca
    - Hyrruian funding is often sought after and rarely obtained; even amongst the anarchic communes, winning the favor of the regional nobility is seen as an achievement.
    - Ptha's recent civil wars have advanced certain communes' science far further than they would have without the conflict. Some suspect that Biylilca may have had a hand in prolonging that conflict...
    - While they do not look down upon the Vicirx people as much as Phonelians do, they still regard them as backwater and unenlightened. They are the only nation with access to the unique Vicirx steel.
    - Phonelians are largely seen as decadent and uninteresting elites, more concerned with lounging about discussing matters rather than delving into the difficult labors of magic and science. However, it is far from unusual for a Biylilcan to seek employment in Phonelia, or to collaborate with their scientists on matters far more practical than Biylilca tends to follow.
