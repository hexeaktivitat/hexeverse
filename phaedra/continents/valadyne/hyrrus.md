# Hyrrus

- Closest real-world analogue is ancient Greece, with tendencies towards city-states.

## Cultural Characteristics

- Dark-hued skin, befitting a cultural cohort close to the equatorial regions of Phaedra.
- Light-brown, wispy hair
- Vibrant purple and indigo-toned eyes
- Hefty and strong
- For formal situations, many will dress in manners befitting their ancestral class, from before the revolution when class was more stratified
- Rough-textured skin, close to scales in feel, but distinctly humanoid skin
- Most members of Hyrrian society belong to the same general ethic makeup, but especially since the end of the imperial days, it's unremarkable to encounter someone outside of the general Hyrrian appearances.

## Societial Values

Leadership is a prized trait amongst Hyrrians. They tend value those who lead with compassion and strength, though sometimes, especially among the more conservative, they tend to prize strength above all else. Along those lines, courage is also well-regarded. This tendency towards courage tends to be rewarded, both within the society and within its own mythologizing; the nobility unlocking the secrets of the Valadyne Tower in the face of invasion is one of the most oft-repeated examples of Hyrrian courage being rewarded -- even as the descendants of those nobles find themselves regarded with bemusment at best and disdain at worst.

A historical class-based system dating back before the imperial days has all but been disposed with, but vestiges of this linger in society. Most notable in the laborers of Invidus and the nobility of Torrus, but nearly everyone is able to trace their lineage back to one of seven different distinct social classes.

Hyrrians have a broad sense of family, and a family unit often contains many extended members of a family - parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, siblings, cousins, etc. There is often a major to-do when marraiges occur as to which family the newlyweds will be part of -- often this follows a matrilineal pattern, but it's unremarkable if that custom is not followed.

## Religion

Religion is unstructured in Hyrrian society, often rooted in family-based practices. The only constantly agreed-upon aspect of their religious practices concerns Hephsnos, a legendary god-like deity who descended from the Heavens aeons ago and granted the Hyrrians the gift of knowledge. Most house religions make some passing mention of Hephsnos, but even then they are rarely the most important. Scholars tend to believe the Hephsnos was a real being, and that they were connected to the Tower and the sky islands -- some daringly suggest that they were an emissary from beyond the sky. Hephsnos is regarded to have vanished millenia ago, but there are rumors that they still stand watch inside the Valadyne Tower, guarding some of its most well-kept secrets even from the nobility.

This highly-personal religion means Hyrrus has a cottage industry for a vast array of iconography, and it's considered customary for Hyrrians to purchase icons for themselves and their family and friends nearly constantly. These icons are largely used as house decorations. It's not unusual for a family member to take up a clerical study; while there are no unified practices, there are a lot of commonalities, and nearly every family has someone who has been through the vestment process and functions as a family priest of sorts.

## National History

Founded nearly fifty millenia ago, Hyrrus is one of the oldest nation-states on Phaedra itself - according to its own internal mythology, following a civil war in the heavens, its original populace descended from the Valadyne Tower and populated the dense, lush forest on the surface. There are few historical records to verify such a claim available to the public at large, but the few extant records do confirm that Hyrrian nobility have some connection to the Tower.

The current regent, Aburia, is near the end of her term. Well-liked and well-regarded, her thirty-year stint has been beneficial for Hyrrus. It is likely that her Vice-Regent, Colun, will be elected when her term concludes, but the more conservative nobility always see the end of a regential term as an opportunity to wedge their dreams of empire back into the public discourse. One noble, Vahrain, has long been seeking a way to foreground more than just dreams of empire, however...

### Torrus

The capital city, nestled on the Limnos Archipelago, is considered one of the grandest in all of Phaedra. Its imperial past has all but been forgotten, as an uprising nearly twenty millenia ago forced the imperial nobility, long rulers of the land, to cede power to its citizens. They still wield tremendous power, not least of which because they control access to the Valadyne Tower and its mysterious inner workings, but their influence is held in check. Most of the nobility accept their diminished status, but a few of them still cling to myths of bygone days and seek to revert the nation back under their rule.

### Invidus

Invidus is the manufacturing center and the heart to the economy of Hyrrus. This came at a severe price: the city is a former penal colony from imperial days. Blood and oppression is writ into the very streets and buildings of the city, and many of its residents consider themselves the face of revolution in Hyrrian society. Following the liberation of the prisoners during the uprising, many chose to stay on the lands and facilities they labored on, working for themselves now instead of the state. In return, Invidus was granted a special invocation from the nascent popular government: use your profits to better yourselves, and our nation will benefit from it. Almost an entire nation unto itself, Invidus has repaid Hyrrus far better than any taxation or levies could: they have recreated and rewrought the image of Hyrrus from that of a corrupt empire to a laborer's paradise. A unique deal with merchants allows both Invidus and the rest of Hyrrus to profit from their goods, and an Invidus-made tool or furnishing is considered a prize possession by all across Phaedra--all the more surprising, considering how common their goods can be.

### Solum

One of the northernmost cities, part of the small border Hyrrus shares with Vicirx. While nominally loyal to Hyrrus, many of its population bear sympathies for their northern neighbor, and it was only a few millenia ago that their secession crisis prompted a Vicirx invasion that nearly took down the government itself. Secession talks still linger in the city, and it is brought up every now and then at the council, and while each time the support grows, enough citizens, relatives of those betrayed by Vicirx during the crisis, manage to remind them of what the reality is.
