# Hyrrus

## National History

Founded nearly fifty millenia ago, Hyrrus is one of the oldest nation-states on Phaedra itself - according to its own internal mythology, following a civil war in the heavens, its original populace descended from the Valadyne Tower and populated the dense, lush forest on the surface. There are few historical records to verify such a claim available to the public at large, but the few extant records do confirm that Hyrrian nobility have some connection to the Tower.

### Torrus

The capital city, nestled on the Limnos Archipelago, is considered one of the grandest in all of Phaedra. Its imperial past has all but been forgotten, as an uprising nearly twenty millenia ago forced the imperial nobility, long rulers of the land, to cede power to its citizens. They still wield tremendous power, not least of which because they control access to the Valadyne Tower and its mysterious inner workings, but their influence is held in check. Most of the nobility accept their diminished status, but a few of them still cling to myths of bygone days and seek to revert the nation back under their rule.

### Invidus

Invidus is the manufacturing center and the heart to the economy of Hyrrus. This came at a severe price: the city is a former penal colony from imperial days. Blood and oppression is writ into the very streets and buildings of the city, and many of its residents consider themselves the face of revolution in Hyrrian society. Following the liberation of the prisoners during the uprising, many chose to stay on the lands and facilities they labored on, working for themselves now instead of the state. In return, Invidus was granted a special invocation from the nascent popular government: use your profits to better yourselves, and our nation will benefit from it. Almost an entire nation unto itself, Invidus has repaid Hyrrus far better than any taxation or levies could: they have recreated and rewrought the image of Hyrrus from that of a corrupt empire to a laborer's paradise. A unique deal with merchants allows both Invidus and the rest of Hyrrus to profit from their goods, and an Invidus-made tool or furnishing is considered a prize possession by all across Phaedra--all the more surprising, considering how common their goods can be.

### Solum

One of the northernmost cities, part of the small border Hyrrus shares with Vicirx. While nominally loyal to Hyrrus, many of its population bear sympathies for their northern neighbor, and it was only a few millenia ago that their secession crisis prompted a Vicirx invasion that nearly took down the government itself. Secession talks still linger in the city, and it is brought up every now and then at the council, and while each time the support grows, enough citizens, relatives of those betrayed by Vicirx during the crisis, manage to remind them of what the reality is.
