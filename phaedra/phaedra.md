# Phaedra

- 3 moons
- Sky islands fabricated by interstellar colonists of eld
- Orbital space station regarded as a higher deity
- Humanoid lifespan is several Earth centuries

Tempel of the Asura
- Regarded as mystics and sages, the members of the Tempel are considered wise beyond their years and suffuse with the mysteries of existence. Their mysteries are well-kept, and only a select few outside their order even glimpse their full truth. (They communicate with beings beyond the Phaedric realm, functioning as an outcrop of the Universal Culture)

Major sea routes connect the four continents of Phaedra, but few outside the merchants make the journey regularly. It is uncommon, but hardly unusual, for someone to have visited another continent for leisure. Legends of distant lands are sometimes embellished but rarely wholly inaccurate, and major cultural cornerstones for all cultures are generally available in the local languages.
